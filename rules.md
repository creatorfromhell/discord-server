## 🙏 Respect Others & Conduct

- 🙌 Use common sense and be respectful to everyone.  
- 🔇 No harassment, flaming, slurs, or trolling.  
- 🧠 Be kind, patient, and constructive — **help is a privilege, not a right**.  
- ❌ Absolutely no NSFW content, hate speech, or discriminatory behavior.  
- 😶 No inappropriate usernames or avatars.  
- 🔕 Do not ping `@creatorfromhell` or other staff directly without reason.  
- 🙅‍♂️ Do not ask for support with **cracked servers** or **hybrid server setups** — use SpongeForge.

---

## 📢 No Spam, Advertising, or Controversy

- 🚫 No self-promotion or advertising (Discords, Minecraft servers, etc.)  
- 🚫 No political, religious, or other controversial discussions  
- 🧼 Keep channels clean and relevant — **post in the correct one**

---

## 🚫 No Unnecessary Pinging

- ⚠️ Do not ping moderators, staff, or roles unless absolutely necessary  
- ⛔ Mass, random, or role-wide pings = **72-hour ban + 2 warnings**

## 💬 Support & Questions

- 💡 Ask questions in `#🐛・support`, **not DMs**  
- 📑 Bug reports must include:  
  - `config.yml`, currency files, `latest.log`  
  - Clear reproduction steps  
- 💬 Feature requests must include:  
  - The **benefit to the community**  
  - Suggested config/commands

> 🗂️ **Paste logs/configs via:**  
> https://paste.ee/ or https://mclo.gs/  
> _Don’t paste huge blocks in chat — it’s not 2002._

- ⚙️ Mods may request logs or configs; refusal may result in denied support  
- 🙅‍♀️ Mods are volunteers — **not your emotional outlet**

---

## 🛠️ Docs, Reviews, and Suggestions

- 📖 Read documentation when shared — ignoring it wastes time  
- 🧠 Repeatedly asking answered questions may lead to limited support  
- 📝 Use the suggestions bot (see `🤖 bot-how-to`) for feature ideas  
- ✍️ Reviews are not for support.  
  - ✅ Fair feedback is fine
